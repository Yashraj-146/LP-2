## About

This repository contains solutions to DSA problems across multiple categories. It is designed to help learners and developers practice and improve their problem-solving skills in DSA, while also serving as a resource for interview preparation.

The problems are solved in **C++** and cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- And more...

## Problem Categories

The repository is organized by problem categories, with each category containing solutions to specific types of DSA problems. Below are some key categories (based on the file structure):

- **Array Problems:** Efficient solutions to common array-based questions.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Optimized solutions with a focus on subproblem overlap and optimal substructure properties.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Solutions involving BFS, DFS, shortest paths, and more.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Classic algorithms like binary search and quicksort.
- **Recursion and Backtracking:** Problems requiring recursive solutions and backtracking strategies.

Each file is named intuitively to reflect its purpose, making it easy to navigate and use.
